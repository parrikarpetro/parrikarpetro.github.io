          <h1>Card Payment Issues ?</h1>
          <p>Let's discuss the common card payment issue that occurs in general, couple of assumption and terminology you should be aware of:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Merchant</b>: The business owner where you buy stuff, egs. Gas Station, Grocery shop etc. and his Bank called Merchant's Bank.</li>
              <li><b>Customer</b>: Yourself who buy stuff and pay via cash/card/cheque. and his bank called Customer's bank.</li>
              <li><b>POS Machine</b>: Point of Sale Machine or commanly called Card Swipe Machine.</li>
              <li><b>Payment Gateway</b>: Middle entity between Merchant and Customers bank</li>
          </ul>
        </header>
        <!-- <div class="image fit">

        </div> -->
        <h3>1. Payment failure at Customer Bank side</h3>
        <p class="para-text">
          Let us explain this scenario with an example, Suppose you initiate a card payment at any POS and say the transaction failed i.e. the printed Slip has not come out and your money is debited from the bank. However if the merchant claims that this amount is not credited in his bank account.
          <ul class="para-text-100">
              <li><b>Step 1:</b> To be sure that the transaction has actually failed, Kindly ask for the detailed report from POS machine, now this report contains the list of all the successful transaction, if your card entry is not present, then the transaction has failed.</li>
              <li><b>Step 2:</b> If your money is debited for the failed transaction then it will automatically be reversed within 2 bank working days. Customers bank does the refund.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4 class="para-text">What if the money is not credited within 2 days ?</h4>

        <!--  -->
            <ul class="para-text-100">
                <li>
                    <b>Step 3:</b> If the money is not credited within 2 working days then kindly contact the merchant, ask him to verify the transaction in his settlement records (merchants bank statement).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Step 4:</b> If this failed transaction is not listed in his record, then you may take a written note/email from the merchant that its not credited to the merchant bank.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Step 5:</b> Next you must visit your bank, and ask the Bank manager to raise a <b>Chargebank</b> (A simple Bank process to get refund fast) Once the bank manager marks this transaction under the Chargeback process, you will get the refund within 5 working days.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para-text">
                Everything can be done over a phone call.
            </p>

        <h4 class="para-text">Now, you must be wondering where the money has gone ?</h4>
        <p class="para-text-100">Card Payments internally is a complex process, to brief you up. There is a middle entity between Customers and  Merchants bank called <b>The Payment Gateway</b> (for example <i>MarsterCard, Visa, RuPay</i>) who are responsible for carrying out the transaction.
            <br>  When a card is swiped, Merchants Bank contacts Customers Bank via Payment Gateway and request for payment initialization. Customers bank debits the amount and give it to the Payment gateways who then pass this amount to the Merchants Bank.
            <br>  Once the merchants bank receives this amount, the POS machine generates a slip and the transaction is successful.
            If due to any error the Merchants bank does not receive the amount then the transaction is termed as unsuccessful/failed. But this money gets trapped with Payment Gateway. Who then does the refund and money gets deposited back in customers account(this process may take 2 working days, or may take more time in which you have to do the process as explained in above 5 steps).
            <br>Sounds complicated right? this entire transaction process happens within a fraction of a second.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>2. Payment failure at Merchants Bank side</h3>
        <p class="para-text">Card transaction may fail at the merchants bank side. If there occurs any error at the merchant bank side, this transaction will fail, But however you will get a printed slip from the POS terminal stating the exact status and this money will be credited within 24 Hours.</p>
